# Latex class with the École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS) letterhead
------------------

This custom LaTeX letter class is specifically designed for creating letters 
with the official letterhead of the École de Technologie Supérieure 
of Montréal (ETS). The class provides a convenient and standardized 
template for composing professional correspondence in alignment with the 
visual identity of ETS. By utilizing this class, users can effortlessly 
generate letters that adhere to the institution's branding guidelines, 
maintaining a consistent and professional appearance throughout 
their communication.

**Notes:**

* You need to compile the document using XeLaTeX as this class uses
  the Delta Jaeger font family as recommended by ETS' "Image de marque ÉTS" 
  document, Section Applications, page 2. 
* The logos are PDF versions of the PS files available at ETS' website.
* This class uses the [eforms](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/eforms) package 
  to create the signature field. The package is part of the 
  "The AcroTeX education bundle" and is included here in the 
  `./acrotex` directory as it is a Contrib in TexLive.
